# Emulating the Sense HAT

The talented programmers over at [trinket.io](https://trinket.io/) have created a Sense HAT emulator. This can be used to play with scripts when your Sense HAT is not available, or to create tutorials on using the Sense HAT that can be embedded on a web-page.

The SenseHAT emulator will be used throughout this guide to explain certain features of the Sense HAT. You can test any of the programs by clicking on the run button, and even edit the code in the embedded examples to play with different features.
